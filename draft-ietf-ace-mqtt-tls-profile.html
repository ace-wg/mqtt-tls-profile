  <h1 id="rfc.section.1">
<a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document specifies a profile for the ACE framework <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>.  In this profile, Clients and Servers (Brokers) use MQTT to exchange Application Messages.  The protocol relies on TLS for communication security between entities. The MQTT protocol interactions are described based on the <a href="#MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5" class="xref">MQTT v5.0 - the OASIS Standard</a>.  Since it is expected that MQTT deployments will continue to support MQTT v3.1.1 clients, this document also describes a reduced set of protocol interactions for <a href="#MQTT-OASIS-Standard" class="xref">MQTT v3.1.1 - the OASIS Standard</a>.  However, MQTT v5.0 is the RECOMMENDED version as it works more naturally with ACE-style authentication and authorization.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">MQTT is a publish-subscribe protocol and after connecting to the MQTT Server (Broker), a Client can publish and subscribe to multiple topics.  The Broker, which acts as the Resource Server (RS), is responsible for distributing messages published by the publishers to their subscribers. In the rest of the document the terms "RS", "MQTT Server" and "Broker" are used interchangeably.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">Messages are published under a Topic Name, and subscribers must subscribe to the Topic Names to receive the corresponding messages.  The Broker uses the Topic Name in a published message to determine which subscribers to relay the messages.  In this document, topics, more specifically, Topic Names, are treated as resources.  The Clients are assumed to have identified the publish/subscribe topics of interest out-of-band (topic discovery is not a feature of the MQTT protocol).  A Resource Owner can pre-configure policies at the Authorisation Server (AS) that give Clients publish or subscribe permissions to different topics.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Clients prove their permission to publish and subscribe to topics hosted on an MQTT broker using an access token, bound to a proof-of-possession (PoP) key.  This document describes how to authorize the following exchanges between the Clients and the Broker.  <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-pubsub-profile" class="xref">ACE Pub-Sub Profile</a>.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Connection requests from the Clients to the Broker</li>
<li>Publish requests from the Clients to the Broker, and from the Broker to the Clients</li>
<li>Subscribe requests from Clients to the Broker</li>
</ul>

<a href="#rfc.section.2.1">2.1.</a> Client Token Request to the Authorization Server (AS)</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.1">The first step in the protocol flow (Figure 1 (A)) is the token acquisition by the Client from the AS. The Client and the AS MUST perform mutual authentication.  The Client requests an access token from the AS as described in Section 5.6.1 of the <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">ACE framework</a>, however, it MUST set the profile parameter to 'mqtt_tls'. The media format is 'application/ace+json'.  The AS uses JSON in the payload of its responses to both to the Client and the RS.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.2">If the AS successfully verifies the access token request and authorizes the Client for the indicated audience (i.e. RS) and scopes (i.e. publish/subscribe permissions over topics), the AS issues an access token (Figure 1 (B)). The response includes the parameters described in Section 5.6.2 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">the ACE framework</a>.  The returned token is a Proof-of-Possession (PoP) token by default.  This document follows <a href="#RFC7800" class="xref">RFC 7800</a> for PoP semantics for JWTs.  The PoP token includes a 'cnf' parameter with a symmetric or asymmetric PoP key.  Note that the 'cnf' parameter in the web tokens are to be consumed by the RS and not the Client.  For the asymmetric case, the PoP token may include the 'rs_cnf' parameter containing the information about the public key to be used by the RS to authenticate as described in <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-params" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-params]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.p.3">The AS returns error responses for JSON-based interactions following Section 5.2 of <a href="#RFC6749" class="xref">RFC 6749</a>.

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.1">The Client and the Broker MUST perform mutual authentication.  The Client MUST authenticate to the Broker either over MQTT or TLS.  For MQTT, the options are "None" and "ace".  For TLS, the options are "Anon" for an anonymous client, and "Known(RPK/PSK)" for Raw Public Keys (RPK) and Pre-Shared Keys (PSK), respectively.  Combined, client authentication has the following options: </p>

<ul>
<li>"TLS:Anon-MQTT:None": This option is used only for the topics that do not require authorization, including the "authz-info" topic. Publishing to the "authz-info" topic is described in <a href="#app-authzinfo" class="xref">Section 2.2.2</a>.</li>
<li>"TLS:Anon-MQTT:ace": The token is transported inside the CONNECT message, and MUST be validated using one of the methods described in <a href="#app-authzinfo" class="xref">Section 2.2.2</a>. This option also supports a tokenless connection request for AS discovery.</li>
<li>"TLS:Known(RPK/PSK)-MQTT:none": For the RPK, the token MUST have been published to the "authz-info" topic.  For the PSK, the token MAY be, alternatively, provided in the "psk_identity".  The TLS session set-up is as described in <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize" class="xref">DTLS profile for ACE</a>.</li>
<li>"TLS:Known(RPK/PSK)-MQTT:ace": This option SHOULD NOT be chosen. In any case, the token transported in the CONNECT overwrites any permissions passed during the TLS authentication.</li>
</ul>

<p> It is RECOMMENDED that the Client follows TLS:Anon-MQTT:ace.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.2">The Broker MUST be authenticated during the TLS handshake.  If the Client authentication uses TLS:Known(RPK/PSK), then the Broker is authenticated using the respective method.  Otherwise, to authenticate the Broker, the client MUST validate a public key from a X.509 certificate or an RPK from the Broker against the 'rs_cnf' parameter in the token response.  The AS MAY include the thumbprint of the RS's X.509 certificate in the 'rs_cnf' (thumbprint as defined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-cose-x509" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-cose-x509]</a>). In this case, the client MUST validate the RS certificate against this thumbprint.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.1">In the cases when the Client MUST transport the token to the Broker first, the Client connects to the Broker to publish its token to the "authz-info" topic.  The "authz-info" topic MUST be publish-only (i.e. the Clients are not allowed to subscribe to it).  "authz-info" is not protected, and hence, the Client uses the "TLS:Anon-MQTT:None" option over a TLS connection.  After publishing the token, the Client disconnects from the Broker and is expected to reconnect using client authentication over TLS (i.e. TLS:Known(RPK/PSK)-MQTT:none).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.2">The Broker stores and indexes all tokens received to the "authz-info" topic in its key store (similar to <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-dtls-authorize" class="xref">DTLS profile for ACE</a>).  This profile follows the recommendation of Section 5.8.1 of the <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">ACE framework</a>, and expects that the Broker stores only one token per proof-of-possession key, and any other token linked to the same key overwrites an existing token.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.3">The Broker MUST verify the validity of the token (i.e. through local validation or introspection) as described in <a href="#token_validation" class="xref">Section 2.2.5</a>.  To validate the token, RS MAY need to introspect the token with the AS, e.g. if the token is a reference.  If the token is not valid, the Broker MUST discard the token.  Depending on the QoS level of the PUBLISH message, the Broker returns the error response as a PUBACK or a DISCONNECT message.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.4">If the QoS level is equal to 0, and the token is invalid or the claims cannot be obtained in the case of an introspected token, the Broker MUST send a DISCONNECT message with the reason code '0x87 (Not authorized)'.  If the PUBLISH payload does not parse to a token, the RS MUST send a DISCONNECT with the reason code '0x99 (Payload format invalid)'.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.5">If the QoS level of the PUBLISH message is greater than or equal to 1, the Broker MUST return 'Not authorized' in PUBACK.  If the PUBLISH payload does not parse to a token, the PUBACK reason code is '0x99 (Payload format invalid)'.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.6">It must be noted that when the RS sends the 'Not authorized' response, this corresponds to the token being invalid, and not that the actual PUBLISH message was not authorized.  Given that the "authz-info" is a public topic, this response is not expected to cause confusion.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.3.p.1">This section describes how the Client transports the token to the Broker (RS) inside the CONNECT message. If this method is used, the Client TLS connection is expected to be anonymous, and the Broker is authenticated during the TLS connection set-up.  The approach described in this section is similar to an earlier proposal by Fremantle et al <a href="#fremantle14" class="xref">[fremantle14]</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.3.p.2">After sending the CONNECT, the client MUST NOT send any packets other than DISCONNECT or AUTH that is in response to the broker AUTH until it has received a CONNACK.  Similarly, the server MUST NOT process any packets other than DISCONNECT or an AUTH that is sent in response to its AUTH before it has sent a CONNACK.  </p>
<p><a href="#mqtt5_connect_message" class="xref">Figure 2</a> shows the structure of the MQTT CONNECT message used in MQTT v5.0.  A CONNECT message is composed of a fixed header, a variable header and a payload.  The fixed header contains the Control Packet Type (CPT), Reserved, and Remaining Length fields.  The Variable Header contains the Protocol Name, Protocol Level, Connect Flags, Keep Alive, and Properties fields.  The Connect Flags in the variable header specify the properties of the MQTT session.  It also indicates the presence or absence of some fields in the Payload.  The payload contains one or more encoded fields, namely a unique Client identifier for the Client, a Will Topic, Will Payload, User Name and Password.  All but the Client identifier can be omitted depending on flags in the Variable Header.  </p>

<p class="figure">Figure 3: CONNECT flags for AUTH</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.3.p.5">The Will Flag indicates that a Will message needs to be sent if the network connection is not closed normally. The situations in which the Will message is published include disconnections due to I/O or network failures, and the server closing the network connection due to a protocol error.  The Client may set the Will Flag as desired (marked as 'X' in <a href="#mqttv5_connect_flags" class="xref">Figure 3</a>).  If the Will Flag is set to 1 and the Broker accepts the connection request, the Broker must store the Will message and  publish it when the network connection is closed according to Will QoS and Will retain parameters and MQTT Will management rules.  To avoid publishing Will Messages in the case of temporary network disconnections, the Client may specify a Will Delay Interval in the Will Properties.  <a href="#disconnections" class="xref">Section 5</a> explains how the Broker deals with the retained messages in further detail.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.3.p.6">In MQTT v5.0, the Client signals a clean session (i.e. the session does not continue an existing session), by setting the Clean Start Flag to 1 and, the Session Expiry Interval to 0 in the CONNECT message. In this profile, the Broker SHOULD always start with a clean session regardless of how these parameters are set. Starting a clean session helps the Broker avoid keeping unnecessary session state for unauthorised clients. If the Broker starts a clean session, the Broker MUST set the Session Present flag to 0 in the CONNACK packet to signal this to the Client.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.3.p.7">If necessary, the Broker MAY support session continuation, and hence, maintain and use client state from the existing session. The client state MAY include token and its introspection result (for reference tokens) in addition to the MQTT session state.  When reconnecting to the Broker, the Client MUST still provide a token, as well as setting the Clean Start to 0 and supplying a Session Expiry interval in the CONNECT message.  The Broker MUST perform proof-of-possession validation on the provided token.  If the token matches the stored state, the Broker MAY skip introspecting a token by reference, and use the stored introspection result.  Continuing, both the Client and the Broker MUST resend any unacknowledged PUBLISH packets (where QoS &gt; 0) and PUBREL packets. The Broker MUST still verify the Client is authorized to receive or send these packets. When a Client connects with a long Session Expiry Interval, the Broker may need to  maintain Client's MQTT session state after it disconnects for an extended period.  Brokers SHOULD implement administrative policies to limit misuse.  </p>

The success case is illustrated in <a href="#pop_challenge_response" class="xref">Figure 4</a>.  If the Authentication Data contains only the two-byte integer token length and the token, the RS MUST respond with an AUTH packet, with the Authenticate Reason Code set to '0x18 (Continue Authentication)'.  This packet includes the Authentication Method, which MUST be set to 'ace' and Authentication Data. The Authentication Data MUST NOT be empty and contains an 8-byte nonce as a challenge for the Client. The Client responds to this with an AUTH packet with a reason code '0x18 (Continue Authentication)'.  Similarly, the Client packet sets the Authentication Method to 'ace'.  The Authentication Data in the Client's response is formatted as the client nonce length,  the client nonce, and the signature or MAC computed over the RS nonce concatenated with the client nonce.

<a href="#rfc.section.3.1">3.1.</a> PUBLISH Messages from the Publisher Client to the Broker</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.1">On receiving the PUBLISH message, the Broker MUST use the type of message (i.e. PUBLISH) and the Topic name in the message header to match against the scope string in the cached token or its introspection result.  Following the example in the previous section, a client sending a PUBLISH message to 'a/topic3' would be allowed to publish, as the scope includes the  string 'publish_+/topic3'.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.2">If the Client is allowed to publish to the topic, the Broker must publish the message to all valid subscribers of the topic.  In the case of an authorization failure, the Broker MUST return an error, if the Client has set the QoS level of the PUBLISH message to greater than or equal to 1.  Depending on the QoS level, the Broker responds with either a PUBACK or PUBREC packet with reason code '0x87 (Not authorized)'.  On receiving a PUBACK with '0x87 (Not authorized)', the Client MAY reauthenticate by providing a new token as described in <a href="#reauthentication" class="xref">Section 4</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.3">For QoS level 0, the Broker sends a DISCONNECT with reason code '0x87 (Not authorized)' and closes the network connection.  Note that the server-side DISCONNECT is a new feature of MQTT v5.0 (in MQTT v3.1.1, the server needs to drop the connection).  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.2">
<a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> PUBLISH Messages from the Broker to the Subscriber Clients</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">To forward PUBLISH messages to the subscribing Clients, the Broker identifies all the subscribers that have valid matching topic subscriptions (i.e. the tokens are valid, and token scopes allow a subscription to the particular topic).  The Broker sends a PUBLISH message with the Topic name to all the valid subscribers.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.2">The Broker MUST NOT forward messages to the unauthorized subscribers.

<a href="#rfc.section.3.3">3.3.</a> Authorizing SUBSCRIBE Messages</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.1">In MQTT, a SUBSCRIBE message is sent from a Client to the Broker to create one or more subscriptions to one or more topics.  The SUBSCRIBE message may contain multiple Topic Filters.  The Topic Filters may include wildcard characters.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.2">On receiving the SUBSCRIBE message, the Broker MUST use the type of message (i.e.  SUBSCRIBE) and the Topic Filter in the message header to match against a scope string of the stored token or introspection result.  The Topic Filters MUST be equal or a subset of the scopes associated with the Client's token.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.3.3.p.3">As a response to the SUBSCRIBE message, the Broker issues a SUBACK message.  For each Topic Filter, the SUBACK packet includes a return code matching the QoS level for the corresponding Topic Filter. In the case of failure, the return code is 0x87, indicating that the Client is 'Not authorized'. A reason code is returned for each Topic Filter.

The Broker SHOULD check for token expiration on receiving a PINGREQUEST message.  The Broker MAY also check for token expiration periodically, e.g. every hour. This may allow for early detection of a token expiry.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.2">The token expiration is checked by checking the 'exp' claim of a JWT or introspection response, or via performing an introspection request with the AS as described in Section 5.7 of the <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">ACE framework</a>.  Token expirations may trigger the RS to send PUBACK, SUBACK and DISCONNECT messages with return code set to 'Not authorised'. After sending a DISCONNECT message, the network connection is closed, and no more messages can be sent.  However, as a response to the PUBACK and SUBACK, the Client MAY reauthenticate.  The Clients MAY also proactively update their tokens, i.e. before they receive a message with 'Not authorized' return code.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.4.p.3">To start reauthentication, the Client MUST send an AUTH packet with reason code '0x19 (Re-authentication)'.  The Client MUST set the Authentication Method as 'ace' and transport the new token in the Authentication Data.  The Broker accepts reauthentication requests if the Client has already submitted a token (may be expired) and validated via the challenge-response PoP as defined in <a href="#pop_challenge" class="xref">Section 2.2.4.2</a>.  The Client MUST use the challenge-response PoP.  Otherwise, the Broker MUST deny the request.

<p id="rfc.section.5.p.1">In the case of a Client DISCONNECT,  the Broker deletes all the session state but MUST keep the retained messages.  By setting a RETAIN flag in a PUBLISH message, the publisher indicates to the Broker that it should store the most recent message for the associated topic.  Hence, the new subscribers can receive the last sent message from the publisher of that particular topic without waiting for the next PUBLISH message.  The Broker MUST continue publishing the retained messages as long as the associated tokens are valid.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.2">In case of disconnections due to network errors or server disconnection due to a protocol error (which includes authorization errors), the Will message must be sent if the Client supplied a Will in the CONNECT message.  The Client's token scopes MUST include the Will Topic.  The Will message MUST be published to the Will Topic regardless of whether the corresponding token has expired.

To this end, the Broker ignores how the Clean Session Flag is set, and on connection success, the Broker MUST set the Session Present flag to 0 in the CONNACK packet to indicate a clean session to the Client. If the Broker wishes to support session continuation, it MUST still perform proof-of-possession validation on the provided Client token.  MQTT v3.1.1 does not use a Session Expiry Interval, and the Client expects that the Broker maintains the session state after it disconnects.

<p id="rfc.section.6.2.p.1">Handling errors are more primitive in MQTT v3.1.1 due to not having appropriate error fields, error codes, and server-side DISCONNECTs.  Therefore, the broker will disconnect on almost any error and may not keep session state, necessitating clients to make a greater effort to ensure that tokens remain valid and not attempt to publish to topics that they do not have permissions for.  The following lists how the broker responds to specific errors.  </p>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>CONNECT without a token: It is not possible to support AS discovery via sending a tokenless CONNECT message to the Broker. This is because a CONNACK packet in MQTT v3.1.1 does not include a means to provide additional information to the Client.  Therefore, AS discovery needs to take place out-of-band. CONNECT attempt MUST fail.  </li>
<li>Client-RS PUBLISH authorization failure: In the case of a failure, it is not possible to return an error in MQTT v3.1.1.  Acknowledgement messages only indicate success. In the case of an authorization error, the Broker SHOULD disconnect the Client.  Otherwise, it MUST ignore the PUBLISH message. Also, as DISCONNECT messages are only sent from a Client to the Broker, the server disconnection needs to take place below the application layer.  </li>
<li>SUBSCRIBE authorization failure:  In the  SUBACK packet, the return code must be 0x80 indicating 'Failure' for the unauthorized topic(s). Note that, in both MQTT versions, a reason code is returned for each Topic Filter.  </li>
<li>RS-Client PUBLISH authorization failure:  When RS is forwarding PUBLISH messages to the subscribed Clients, it may discover that some of the subscribers are no more authorized due to expired tokens.  These token expirations SHOULD lead to disconnecting the Client rather than silently dropping messages.  </li>

These include repeated token transfer attempts to the public "authz-info" topic, repeated connection attempts, abnormal terminations, and Clients that connect but do not send any data.  If the RS supports the public "authz-info" topic, described in <a href="#app-authzinfo" class="xref">Section 2.2.2</a>, then this may be vulnerable to a DDoS attack, where many Clients use the "authz-info" public topic to transport fictitious tokens, which RS may need to store indefinitely.</p>
<p id="rfc.section.8.p.5">For MQTT v5.0, when a Client connects with a long Session Expiry Interval, the RS may need to  maintain Client's MQTT session state after it disconnects for an extended period. For MQTT v3.1.1, the session state may need to be stored indefinitely, as it does not have a Session Expiry Interval feature.  The RS SHOULD implement administrative policies to limit misuse of the session continuation by the Client.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.9.p.1">The privacy considerations outlined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz" class="xref">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a> apply to this work.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.9.p.2">In MQTT, the RS is a central trusted party and may forward potentially sensitive information between Clients. This document does not protect the contents of the PUBLISH message from the Broker, and hence, the content of the PUBLISH message is not signed or encrypted separately for the subscribers.  This functionality may be implemented using the proposal outlined in <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-pubsub-profile" class="xref">the CoAP Pub-Sub Profile</a>.  However, this solution would still not provide privacy for other properties of the message such as Topic Name.  </p>

</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">Version 05 to 06: </p>

<ul>
<li>Replace the orignally proposed scope format with AIF model. Defined the AIF-MQTT, gave an example with a JSON array. Added a normative reference to the AIF draft.</li>
<li>Clarified client connection after submitting token via "authz-info" topic as TLS:Known(RPK/PSK)-MQTT:none. </li>
<li>Expanded acronyms on their first use including the ones in the title.</li>
<li>Added a definition for "Session".</li>
<li>Corrected "CONNACK" definition, which earlier said it's the first packet sent by the broker.</li>
<li>Added a statement that the the broker will disconnect on almost any error and may not keep session state.</li>
<li>Clarified that the broker does not cache invalid tokens.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.2">Version 04 to 05: </p>

<ul>
<li>Reorganised Section 2 such that "Unauthorised Request: Authorisation Server Discovery" is presented under Section 2.</li>
<li>Fixed Figure 2 to remove the "empty" word.</li>
<li>Clarified that MQTT v5.0 Brokers may implement username/password option for transporting the ACE token only for MQTT v.3.1.1 clients. This option is not recommended for MQTT v.5.0 clients.</li>
<li>Changed Clean Session requirement both for MQTT v.5.0 and v.3.1.1. The Broker SHOULD NOT, instead of MUST NOT, continue sessions.  Clarified expected behaviour if session continuation is supported. Added to the Security Considerations the potential misuse of session continuation.</li>
<li>Fixed the Authentication Data to include token length for the Challenge/Response PoP.</li>
<li>Added that Authorisation Server Discovery is triggered if a token is invalid and not only missing.</li>
<li>Clarified that the Broker should not accept any other packets from Client after CONNECT and before sending CONNACK.</li>
<li>Added that client reauthentication is accepted only for the challenge/response PoP.</li>
<li>Added Ed25519 as mandatory to implement.</li>
<li>Fixed typos.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.3">Version 03 to 04: </p>

<ul>
<li>Linked the terms Broker and MQTT server more at the introduction of the document.</li>
<li>Clarified support for MQTTv3.1.1 and removed phrases that might be considered as MQTTv5 is backwards compatible with MQTTv3.1.1</li>
<li>Corrected the Informative and Normative references.</li>
<li>For AS discovery, clarified the CONNECT message omits the Authentication Data field.  Specified the User Property MUST be set to "ace_as_hint" for AS Request Creation Hints.</li>
<li>Added that MQTT v5 brokers MAY also implement reduced interactions described for MQTTv3.1.1.</li>
<li>Added to Section 3.1, in case of an authorisation failure and QoS level 0, the RS sends a DISCONNECT with reason code '0x87 (Not authorized)'.</li>
<li>Added a pointer to section 4.7 of MQTTv5 spec for more information on topic names and filters.</li>
<li>Added HS256 and RSA256 are mandatory to implement depending on the choice of symmetric or asymmetric validation.</li>
<li>Added MQTT to the TLS exporter label to make it application specific: 'EXPORTER-ACE-MQTT-Sign-Challenge'.</li>
<li>Added a format for Authentication Data so that length values prefix the token (or client nonce) when Authentication Data contains more than one piece of information.</li>
<li>Clarified clients still connect over TLS (server-side) for the authz-info flow. </li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.4">Version 02 to 03: </p>

<ul>
<li>Added the option of Broker certificate thumbprint in the 'rs_cnf' sent to the Client.</li>
<li>Clarified the use of a random nonce from the TLS Exporter for PoP, added to the IANA requirements that the label should be registered.</li>
<li>Added a client nonce, when Challenge/Response Authentication is used between Client and Broker.</li>
<li>Clarified the use of the "authz-info" topic and the error response if token validation fails.</li>
<li>Added clarification on wildcard use in scopes for publish/subscribe permissions</li>
<li>Reorganised sections so that token authorisation for publish/subscribe messages are better placed.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.5">Version 01 to 02: </p>

<ul>
<li>Clarified protection of Application Message payload as out of scope, and cited draft-palombini-ace-coap-pubsub-profile for a potential solution </li>
<li>Expanded Client connection authorization to capture different options for Client and Broker authentication over TLS and MQTT</li>
<li>Removed Payload (and specifically Client Identifier) from proof-of-possession in favor of using tls-exporter for a TLS-session based challenge.</li>
<li>Moved token transport via "authz-info" topic from the Appendix to the main text.</li>
<li>Clarified Will scope. </li>
<li>Added MQTT AUTH to terminology.</li>
<li>Typo fixes, and simplification of figures.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.6">Version 00 to 01: </p>

<ul>
<li>Present the MQTTv5 as the RECOMMENDED version, and MQTT v3.1.1 for backward compatibility. </li>
<li>Clarified Will message. </li>
<li>Improved consistency in the use of terminology and upper/lower case. </li>
<li>Defined Broker and MQTTS. </li>
