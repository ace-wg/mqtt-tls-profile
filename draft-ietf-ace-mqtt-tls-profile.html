  <h1 id="rfc.section.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1">1.</a> Introduction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.1">This document specifies a profile for the ACE framework <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>.  In this profile, clients and a resource server use MQTT to communicate. The protocol relies on TLS for communication security between entities.  The necessary protocol interactions are described based on the <a href="#MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5">MQTT v5.0 - the OASIS Standard</a> <cite title="NONE">[MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5]</cite>.  In addition, this document describes a reduced set of protocol interactions suited to <a href="#MQTT-OASIS-Standard">MQTT v3.1.1 - the OASIS Standard</a> <cite title="NONE">[MQTT-OASIS-Standard]</cite>.  Both versions are expected to be supported in practice, and therefore, covered in this document. However, it is RECOMMENDED to use MQTT v5.0 as it works more naturally with ACE-style authentication and authorisation.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.2">MQTT is a publish-subscribe protocol and supports two main types of client operation: publish and subscribe.  Once connected, a client can publish to multiple topics, and subscribe to multiple topics; however, for this document, these actions are described separately.  The MQTT broker is responsible for distributing messages published by the publishers to the appropriate subscribers.  Each publish message contains a topic, which is used by the broker to filter the subscribers for the message.  Subscribers must subscribe to the topics to receive the corresponding messages.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.3">In this document, message topics are treated as resources.  Clients use an access token, bound to a key (the proof-of-possession key) to authorize with the MQTT broker their connection and publish/subscribe permissions to topics. In the context of this ACE profile, the MQTT broker acts as the resource server.  To provide communication confidentiality and resource server authentication, TLS is used.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.4">Clients use client authorization servers <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-actors">[I-D.ietf-ace-actors]</a> to obtain tokens from the authorization server. The communication protocol between the client authorization server and the authorization server is assumed to be HTTPS.  Also, if the broker supports token introspection, it is assumed to use HTTPS to communicate with the authorization server.  These interfaces MAY be implemented using other protocols, e.g., CoAP or MQTT.  This document makes the same assumptions as the Section 4 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz">the ACE framework</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</cite> regarding client and RS registration with the AS and establishing of keying material.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.5">This document describes the authorization of the following exchanges between clients and the broker.  </p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>Connection establishment between the clients and the broker</li>
  <li>Publish messages from the clients to the broker, and from the broker to the clients</li>
  <li>Subscribe messages from the clients to the broker</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.p.7">These exchanges are described basedon the <a href="#MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5">MQTT v5 - the OASIS Standard</a> <cite title="NONE">[MQTT-OASIS-Standard-v5]</cite>.  A more basic operation is described in <a href="#MQTTv311">Section 3</a> for the <a href="#MQTT-OASIS-Standard">MQTT v3.1.1 - the OASIS Standard</a> <cite title="NONE">[MQTT-OASIS-Standard]</cite>.  This basic operation MAY also be supported in MQTT v5.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.1.1">1.1.</a> Requirements Language</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.1.p.1">The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 <a href="#RFC2119">[RFC2119]</a> <a href="#RFC8174">[RFC8174]</a>, when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.1.2">1.2.</a> ACE-Related Terminology</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.1">The terminology for entities in the architecture is defined in OAuth 2.0 <a href="#RFC6749">RFC 6749 </a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6749]</cite> and <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-actors">ACE actors</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.ietf-ace-actors]</cite>, such as "Client" (C), "Resource Server" (RS) and "Authorization Server" (AS).  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.2">The term "endpoint" is used following its OAuth definition, to denote resources such as /token and /introspect at the AS.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.3">The term "Resource" is used to refer to an MQTT "topic name," which is defined in <a href="#mqtt-defs">Section 1.3</a>.  Hence, the "Resource Owner" is any entity that can authoritatively speak for the "topic".  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.1.2.p.4">Certain security-related terms such as "authentication", "authorization", "confidentiality", "(data) integrity", "message authentication code", and "verify" are taken from  <a href="#RFC4949">RFC 4949</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC4949]</cite>.  </p>

<h1 id="rfc.section.2.1.1"><a href="#rfc.section.2.1.1">2.1.1.</a> Client Authorization Server (CAS) and Authorization Server (AS) Interaction</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.1">The first step in the protocol flow (Figure 1 (A)) is the token acquisition by the client authorization server (CAS) from the AS.  If a client has enough resources and can support HTTPS, or optionally the AS supports MQTTS, these steps can instead be carried out by a client directly.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.2">When requesting an access token from the AS, the CAS MAY include parameters in its request as defined in Section 5.6.1 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz">the ACE framework</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</cite>.  The content type is set to "application/json". The profile parameter is set to 'mqtt_tls'.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.3">If the AS successfully verifies the access token request and authorizes the client for the indicated audience (e.g., RS) and scopes (e.g., publish/subscribe permissions over topics), the AS issues an access token (Figure 1 (B)).  The response includes the parameters described in Section 5.6.2 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz">the ACE framework</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</cite>.  The included token is assumed to be Proof-of-Possession (PoP) token by default. Hence,  a 'cnf' parameter with a symmetric or asymmetric PoP key is returned. The token may be a reference, or a CBOR or JWT web token.  Note that the 'cnf' parameter in the web tokens are to be consumed by the resource server and not the client.  For more information on Proof of Possession semantics in JWTs see <a href="#RFC7800">RFC 7800</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC7800]</cite> and for CWTs, see <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession">Proof-of-Possession Key Semantics for CBOR Web Tokens (CWTs)</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.ietf-ace-cwt-proof-of-possession]</cite>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.1.p.4">In the case of an error, the AS returns error responses for HTTP-based interactions as ASCII codes in JSON content, as defined in Section 5.2 of <a href="#RFC6749">RFC 6749</a> <cite title="NONE">[RFC6749]</cite>.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.1.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2.1.2">2.1.2.</a> <a href="#connect_v5" id="connect_v5">Client Connection Request to the Broker</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.2.p.1">This section describes how the client transports the token to the broker (RS) via the CONNECT control message after the TLS handshake. This is similar to an earlier proposal by Fremantle et al. <a href="#fremantle14">[fremantle14]</a>.  Alternatively, the token may be used for the TLS session establishment as described in the <a href="#I-D.gerdes-ace-dtls-authorize">DTLS profile for ACE</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.gerdes-ace-dtls-authorize]</cite>. In this case, both the TLS PSK and RPK handshakes MAY be supported.  This may additionally require that the client transports the token to the broker before the connection establishment.  To this end, the broker MAY support /authz-info endpoint via the "authz-info" topic.  Then, to transport the token, clients publish to "authz-info" topic unauthorized.  The topic "authz-info" MUST be publish-only for clients (i.e., the clients are not allowed to subscribe to it).  This option is described in more detail in <a href="#app-authzinfo">Appendix B</a>.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.2.p.2">After the token acquisition, the client connects to the RS (broker) using the CONNECT message of MQTT.  <a href="#mqtt5_connect_message">Figure 2</a> shows the structure of the MQTT CONNECT control message used in MQTT v5.  </p>

<p class="figure">Figure 2: MQTT CONNECT control message. (CPT=Control Packet Type, Rsvd=Reserved, len.=length, Proto.=Protocol)</p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.2.p.3">To communicate the necessary connection parameters, the client uses the appropriate flags of the CONNECT message. To achieve a clean session (i.e., the session should start without an existing session), the session flags MUST be set appropriately: the Clean Start Flag MUST be set to 1 and Session Expiry Interval MUST be set to 0.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.2.p.4">The Will flag indicates that a Will message needs to be sent when a client disconnection occurs.  The situations in which the Will message is published include disconnections due to I/O or network failures, and the server closing the networking connection due to a protocol error.  The client may set the Will flag as desired .  If the Will flag is set to 1 and the broker accepts the connection request, the broker must store the Will message, and  publish it when the network connection is closed according to Will QoS and Will retain parameters, and MQTT Will management rules.  <a href="#disconnections">Section 2.5</a> explains how the broker deals with the retained messages in further detail.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.2.p.5">For token transport, the RS MUST support AUTH (Authentication Exchange) method. The RS SHOULD also support token transport via username and password, which is described in  <a href="#MQTTv311">Section 3</a> for MQTT v3.1.1.  The rest of this section describes the AUTH method.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.2.p.6">To use the AUTH method, the username flag MUST be set to 0, and the password flag MUST be set to 0.  The client can set the Authentication Method as a property of a CONNECT packet by setting Auth Properties (with the property identifier 0x15).  The client must MUST set the UTF-8 encoded string containing the name of the authentication method as 'ace'. If the RS does not support this profile, it sends a CONNACK with a Reason Code of '0x8C (Bad authentication method)'.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.2.p.7">The Authentication Method is followed by the Authentication Data, which has a property identifier 0x16.  Authentication Data is binary data and is defined by  the authentication method. The RS MAY support different implementations for transporting the Authentication Data. The first option is that Authentication Data contains both the token and the keyed message digest (MAC) or signature. The client MUST apply the PoP key to the entire request by computing a keyed message digest (for symmetric key) or a digital signature (for asymmetric key). The CONNECT message is assumed to have enough randomness in the payload, and inside a TLS session (excluding the 0-RTT case) will not be exposed to a replay attack.  When either cannot be guaranteed, the Authentication Data MAY also contain a nonce.  The encoding of this field MAY use CBOR and COSE.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.2.p.8">The token is validated as described in  <a href="#token_validation">Section 2.1.3</a>  and the server responds with a CONNACK.  The reason code of the CONNACK is '0x00 (Success)' if the authentication is successful.  In case of an invalid PoP token, the CONNACK reason code is '0x87 (Not Authorized)'.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.2.p.9">The second option that RS may accept is a challenge/response protocol. If the Authentication Data only includes the token, the RS MUST respond with an AUTH packet, with the Authenticate Reason Code set to '0x18 (Continue Authentication)'. This packet includes the Authentication Method, which MUST be set to 'ace' and Authentication Data. The Authentication Data MUST NOT be empty and contains a challenge for the client. The client responds to this with an AUTH packet with a reason code '0x18 (Continue Authentication)'. Similarly, the client packet sets the Authentication Method to 'ace'.  The Authentication Data in the client's response contains the signature or MAC computed over the RS's challenge.  To this, the server responds with a CONNACK and return code '0x00 (Success)' if the authentication is successful.  In case of an invalid PoP token, the CONNACK reason code is '0x87 (Not Authorized)'.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.2.p.10">Finally, this document allows the CONNECT message to have an empty Authentication Data field. This is the AS discovery option and the RS responds with the CONNACK reason code '0x87 (Not Authorized)' and includes a User Property for the AS information.  AS Information contains the absolute URI of AS, and MAY also contain a cnonce as described in the Section 5.1 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz">the ACE framework</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</cite>.  This information MAY be CBOR encoded.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.1.3"><a href="#rfc.section.2.1.3">2.1.3.</a> <a href="#token_validation" id="token_validation">Token Validation</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.3.p.1">RS MUST verify the validity of the token.  This validation MAY be done locally (e.g., in the case of a self-contained token) or the RS MAY send an introspection request to the AS.  If introspection is used, this section follows similar steps to those described in Sections 5.7 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz">the ACE framework</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</cite>.  The communication between AS and RS MAY be HTTPS, but it, in every case, MUST be confidential, mutually authenticated and integrity protected.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.3.p.2">The broker MUST check if the token is active either using 'exp' claim of the token or 'active' parameter of the introspection response.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.3.p.3">The access token is constructed by the AS such that RS can associate the access token with the client key.  This document assumes that the Access Token is a PoP token as described in <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</a>.  Therefore, the necessary information is contained in the 'cnf' claim of the access token and may use either public or shared key approaches.  The client uses the signature or the MAC embedded in the CONNECT message (e.g., Authentication Data field in MQTTv5) to prove the possession of the key.  The resource server validates the signature or the MAC over the contents of the packet, authenticating the client.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.3.p.4">The broker uses the scope field in the token (or in the introspection result) to determine the publish and subscribe permissions for the client. If the Will flag is set, then the broker MUST check that the token allows the publication of the Will message too.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.3.p.5">If the token is not self-contained and the broker uses token introspection, it MAY cache the validation result to decide whether to accept subsequent PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE messages. PUBLISH and SUBSCRIBE messages, which are sent after a connection set-up, do not contain access tokens.  If the introspection result is not cached, then the RS needs to introspect the saved token for each request.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.3.p.6">Scope strings SHOULD be encoded as a permission, followed by an underscore, followed by a topic filter.  Two permissions apply to topics: 'publish' and 'subscribe'.  An example scope field may contain multiple such strings, space delimited, e.g., 'publish_topic1 subscribe_topic2/#'.  Hence, this access token would give 'publish' permission to the 'topic1', 'subscribe' permission to all the subtopics of 'topic2'.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.3.p.7">Also, if present in the access token, RS must check that the 'iss' corresponds to AS, the 'aud' field corresponds to RS. It also has to check whether 'nbf' and 'iat' claims are present and valid.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.1.4"><a href="#rfc.section.2.1.4">2.1.4.</a> The Broker's Response to Client Connection Request</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.1.4.p.1">Based on the validation result (obtained either via local inspection or using the /introspection interface of the AS), the broker MUST send a CONNACK message to the client.  If the RS accepts the connection, it MUST store the token.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2.2">2.2.</a> Authorizing PUBLISH Messages</h1>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2.1"><a href="#rfc.section.2.2.1">2.2.1.</a> PUBLISH Messages from the Publisher Client to the Broker</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.1">On receiving the PUBLISH message, the broker MUST use the type of message (i.e., PUBLISH) and the topic name in the message header to compare against the cached token or its introspection result.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.2">If the client is allowed to publish to the topic, the RS must publish the message to all valid subscribers of the topic. The broker may also return an acknowledgment message if the QoS level is greater than or equal to 1.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.3">In case of an authorisation failure, an error MAY be returned to the client. To take advantage of this for PUBLISH messages, the QoS level should be set to greater than or equal to 1. This guarantees that RS responds with either a PUBACK or PUBREC packet with reason code '0x87 (Not authorized)'.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.1.p.4">On receiving a PUBACK with '0x87 (Not authorized)', the client may reauthenticate as described in <a href="#reauthentication">Section 2.4</a> </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.2.2"><a href="#rfc.section.2.2.2">2.2.2.</a> PUBLISH Messages from the Broker to the Subscriber Clients</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.1">To forward PUBLISH messages to the subscribing clients, the broker identifies all the subscribers that have valid matching topic subscriptions (i.e., the tokens are valid, and token scopes allow a subscription to the particular topic name).  The broker sends a PUBLISH message with the topic name and the topic message to all the valid subscribers.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.2.2.p.2">In MQTT, after connection establishment, there is no way to inform a client that an authorization error has occurred for previously subscribed topics, e.g., token expiry.  In the case of an authorization error, the broker disconnects the client.  To disconnect the client, the RS SHOULD send a DISCONNECT message with the reason code '0x87 (Not authorized)'. Note that the server-side DISCONNECT is a new feature of MQTT v5 (in MQTT v3.1.1, the server needs to drop the connection).  RS MUST stop forwarding messages to the unauthorized subscribers.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.3"><a href="#rfc.section.2.3">2.3.</a> Authorizing SUBSCRIBE Messages</h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.1">In MQTT, a SUBSCRIBE message is sent from a client to the broker to create one or more subscriptions to one or more topics.  The SUBSCRIBE message may contain multiple topic filters.  The topic filters may include wildcard characters.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.2">On receiving the SUBSCRIBE message, the broker MUST use the type of message (i.e., SUBSCRIBE) and the topic filter in the message header to compare against the stored token or introspection result.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.3.p.3">As a response to the SUBSCRIBE message, the broker issues a SUBACK message. For each topic filter, the SUBACK packet includes a return code matching the QoS level for the corresponding topic filter. In the case of failure, the return code is 0x87, indicating that the client is 'Not authorized'.  A reason code is returned for each topic filter.  Therefore, the client may receive success codes for a subset of its topic filters, while being unauthorized for the rest.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.4"><a href="#rfc.section.2.4">2.4.</a> <a href="#reauthentication" id="reauthentication">Token Expiration and Reauthentication</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.1">The broker MUST check for token expiration whenever a CONNECT, PUBLISH or SUBSCRIBE message is received or sent. The broker SHOULD check for token expiration on receiving a PINGREQUEST message. This may allow for early detection of a token expiry.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.2">The token expiration is checked by checking the 'exp' claim of a CWT/JWT or via performing an introspection request with the Authorization server as described in Section 5.7 of <a href="#I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz">the ACE framework</a> <cite title="NONE">[I-D.ietf-ace-oauth-authz]</cite>.  Token expirations may trigger the RS to send PUBACK, SUBACK and DISCONNECT messages with return code set to 'Not authorised'.  To these messages, the client MAY respond with re-authentication.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.4.p.3">To re-authenticate, the client sends an AUTH packet with reason code '0x19 (Re-authentication)'. The client MUST set the authentication method as 'ace' and transport the new token in the Authentication Data.  The client and the RS go through the same steps for proof of possession validation as described in <a href="#connect_v5">Section 2.1.2</a>.  If the re-authentication fails, the server MUST send a DISCONNECT with the reason code '0x87 (Not Authorized)'.  The clients can also proactively update their tokens without before they receive a message with 'Not authorized' return code.  </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.2.5"><a href="#rfc.section.2.5">2.5.</a> <a href="#disconnections" id="disconnections">Handling Disconnections and Retained Messages</a></h1>
<p/>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.2">In the case of a client DISCONNECT, due to the Clean Session flag, the broker deletes all session state but MUST keep the retained messages.  By setting a RETAIN flag in a PUBLISH message, the publisher indicates to the broker that it should store the most recent message for the associated topic.  Hence, the new subscribers can receive the last sent message from the publisher for that particular topic without waiting for the next PUBLISH message.  The broker MUST continue publishing the retained messages as long as the associated tokens are valid.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.2.5.p.3">In case of disconnections due to network errors or server disconnection due to a protocol error (which includes authorization errors), the Will message must be sent if the client supplied a Will in the CONNECT request message.  The token provided in the CONNECT request must cover the Will topic.  The Will message MUST be published to the Will topic when the network connection is closed regardless of whether the corresponding token has expired. In the case of a server-side DISCONNECT, the server returns the '0x87 Not Authorized' return code to the client.  </p>

<p id="rfc.section.3.1.p.5">Section 3.1.3 of <a href="#MQTT-OASIS-Standard">MQTT v3.1.1 - the OASIS Standard</a> <cite title="NONE">[MQTT-OASIS-Standard]</cite> defines the MQTT Username as a UTF-8 encoded string, which is prefixed by a  2-byte length field followed by UTF-8 encoded character data up to 65535 bytes. Therefore an access token that is not a valid UTF-8 MUST be Base64 <a href="#RFC4648">[RFC4648]</a> encoded.  (The MQTT Password allows binary data up to 65535 bytes, and so, does not require encoding.) </p>
<h1 id="rfc.section.3.2"><a href="#rfc.section.3.2">3.2.</a> <a href="#errors_311" id="errors_311">Handling Authorization Errors</a></h1>
<p id="rfc.section.3.2.p.1">Handling errors are more primitive in MQTT v3.1.1 due to not having appropriate error fields, error codes, server-side DISCONNECTS. In the following, we list how errors are handled without such protocol support.  </p>
<p/>

<ul>
  <li>CONNECT without a token: It is not possible to support AS discovery via sending a tokenless CONNECT message to the broker.  This is because a CONNACK packet in MQTT v3.1.1. does not include a means to provide additional information to the client.  Therefore, AS discovery needs to take place out-of-band. CONNECT attempt fails.  </li>
  <li>Client-RS PUBLISH authorisation failure: In case of a failure,  it is not possible to return an error in MQTT v3.1.1.  Acknowledgement messages only indicate success. In the case of an authorization error, the broker SHOULD disconnect the client.  Otherwise, it MUST ignore the PUBLISH message. Also, DISCONNECT messages are only sent from a client to the broker. So, server disconnection needs to take place below the application layer.  </li>
  <li>SUBSCRIBE authorisation failure:  In the  SUBACK packet, the return code must be 0x80 indicating 'Failure' for the unauthorized topic(s).  Note that, in both MQTT versions, a reason code is returned for each topic filter.  </li>
  <li>RS-Client PUBLISH authorisation failure:  When RS is forwarding PUBLISH messages to the subscribed clients, it may discover that some of the subscribers are no more authorized due to expired tokens. These token expirations MAY lead to disconnecting the associated client.  </li>

Mainly, this document provides an authorization solution for MQTT, the responsibility of which is left to the specific implementation in  MQTT v5 standard.  In the following, we comment on a few relevant issues based on the current MQTT specifications.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.3">In this document, RS uses the PoP access token to authenticate the client. If the client is able, TLS certificates sent from the client can be used by the RS to authenticate the client.  The TLS certificate from the RS MUST be used by the client to authenticate the RS.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.4">To authorize a client's publish and subscribe requests in an ongoing session, the RS caches the access token after accepting the connection from the client. However, if some permissions are revoked in the meantime, the RS may still grant publish/subscribe to revoked topics until the session ends or the token expires.  When permissions change dynamically, it is expected that AS follows a reasonable expiration strategy for the access tokens.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.5.p.5">The RS may monitor client behaviour to detect potential security problems, especially those affecting availability.  These include repeated token transfer attempts to the public "authz-info" topic, repeated connection attempts, abnormal terminations, and clients that connect but do not send any data.  If the RS supports the public "authz-info" topic, described in <a href="#app-authzinfo">Appendix B</a>, then this may be vulnerable to a DDoS attack, where many clients use the "authz-info" public topic to transport fictitious tokens, which RS may need to store indefinitely.</p>

<p id="rfc.section.6.p.2">In MQTT, the RS is a central trusted party and may forward potentially sensitive information between clients. Clients may choose to encrypt the payload of their messages.  However, this would not provide privacy for other properties of the message such as topic name.  </p>

<ul>
  <li>AS discovery: For MQTT v5 or  MQTT v3.1.1,  the clients/client authorization servers need to be configured out-of-band. RS does not provide any hints to help AS discovery.  AS discovery is possible with the MQTT v5 described in <a href="#connect_v5">Section 2.1.2</a>.  </li>
  <li>The communication protocol between the client and RS: MQTT</li>
  <li>The security protocol between the client and RS: TLS</li>
  <li>Client and RS mutual authentication: RS provides a server certificate during TLS handshake. Client transports token and MAC via the MQTT CONNECT message.  </li>
  <li>Content format: For the HTTPS interactions with AS, "application/json".  The MQTT payloads may be formatted JSON or CBOR.  </li>
  <li>PoP protocols: Either symmetric or asymmetric keys can be supported.</li>
  <li>Unique profile identifier: mqtt_tls</li>
  <li>Token introspection: RS uses HTTPS /introspect interface of AS.</li>
  <li>Token request: CAS uses HTTPS /token interface of AS.</li>
  <li>/authz-info endpoint: It MAY be supported using the method described in <a href="#app-authzinfo">Appendix B</a>, not protected.  </li>
  <li>Token transport: In MQTT CONNECT message for both versions of MQQ.  AUTH extensions also used for authentication and re-authentication for MQTT v5 as described in <a href="#connect_v5">Section 2.1.2</a>.</li>

<p id="rfc.section.B.p.1">The main document described a method for transporting tokens inside MQTT CONNECT messages.  In this section, we describe an alternative method to transport an access token.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.2">The method consists of the MQTT broker accepting PUBLISH messages to a public "authz-info" topic. A client using this method MUST first connect to the broker, and publish the access token using the "authz-info" topic. The broker must verify the validity of the token (i.e., through local validation or introspection).  After publishing the token, the client disconnects from the broker and is expected to try reconnecting over TLS.  </p>
<p id="rfc.section.B.p.3">In MQTT v5, the broker can return 'Not authorized' error to a PUBLISH request for QoS greater or equal to 1.  In MQTT v3.1.1, after the client published to the "authz-info" topic, it is not possible for the broker to communicate the result of the token verification. In any case, any token authorization failure affect the subsequent TLS handshake, which can prompt the client to obtain a valid token.  </p>
